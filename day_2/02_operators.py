#lets trty mathematical operators
print(3+2/882)
print (13%2) #it is remainder operation
print (6/3) #whenever there is a divide the answer will be a float
#for example 
x= 6/3
print (type(x))
#now to get integer type we just put double // sign
# for exmaple 
y= 12//4
print (type(y))
print (2**6) # double ** shows power operator
